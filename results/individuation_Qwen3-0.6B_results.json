This could be because of an issue with the checkpoint, or because your version of Transformers is out of date.\n\nYou can update Transformers with the command `pip install --upgrade transformers`. If this does not work, and the checkpoint is very new, then there may not be a release version that supports this model yet. In this case, you can get the most up-to-date code by installing Transformers from source with the command `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git`"
