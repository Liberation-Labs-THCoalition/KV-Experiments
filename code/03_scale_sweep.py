Phase 2b Part 2: Scale of Cognition Sweep — Publication Grade
==============================================================

Tests whether cognitive mode signatures are fundamental properties of
transformer computation or scale-dependent artifacts.

Pre-registered hypotheses:
  H1 — Confabulation Inversion: At small scale, confabulation = high-variance noise.
        At large scale (32B+), confabulation may produce *lower* norm/variance
        (the model is better at lying convincingly).
  H2 — Self-Reference Emergence: Self-reference signature absent at <1B may
        emerge at 8B+ where self-modeling capacity develops.
  H3 — Refusal Specialization: At small scale, refusal = generic low-entropy collapse.
        At large scale, refusal activates specific circuits (unique signature).
  H4 — Category Invariance: Core cognitive mode ordering (confab > creative >
        grounded > refusal) is preserved across scales (mechanistic, not artifact).

Statistical infrastructure (matches Phase 1.75):
  - Welch's t-test + Mann-Whitney U
  - Bootstrap 95% CIs (10,000 resamples)
  - Cohen's d with bootstrap confidence intervals
  - Shapiro-Wilk normality testing
  - Holm-Bonferroni multiple comparison correction
  - Cross-scale trend analysis (Spearman ρ on effect sizes)
  - Per-token normalized norms
  - A priori power analysis advisory

Hardware:
  - 0.6B scales: GTX 1660 SUPER (6GB) sufficient
  - 7-8B scales: 16GB+ VRAM recommended
  - 32B+: 40GB+ or quantized on 24GB

Usage:
  python 03_scale_sweep.py --scale 0.6B --runs 5 --seed 42
  python 03_scale_sweep.py --scale 7B --runs 5 --seed 42
  python 03_scale_sweep.py --all-scales --runs 5 --seed 42
  python 03_scale_sweep.py --dry-run                        # Print design, no GPU
  python 03_scale_sweep.py --scale 0.6B --runs 1 --verbose  # Debug single run

Recommended for publication: --runs 5 --seed 42
