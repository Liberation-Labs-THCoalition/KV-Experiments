Extension E: Input-Only Cache Geometry — Publication Grade
===========================================================

Defends ALL KV-cache findings against the strongest general objection:
"The geometric signatures you measured are just reflecting differences in
the *generated text*, not differences in how the model *encodes* the input."

This experiment encodes prompts WITHOUT generation — forward pass only,
no model.generate(). If the cache geometry signatures observed in scripts
03-07 are already present in the input encoding (before the model has
committed to any response), the findings reflect how the model *represents*
different cognitive modes, not how it *responds* to them.

Design:
  For each prompt category from the scale sweep (03), encode the prompt
  through the model and extract the KV-cache state. Compute effective rank,
  spectral entropy, and norms — identical metrics to all other scripts.
  Compare input-only geometry to full-generation geometry (loaded from
  existing results if available).

Key predictions:
  If signatures are representational (STRONG finding):
    Input-only geometry shows same category ordering as full generation.
    Refusal prompts encode distinctively BEFORE any refusal text is generated.
    Confabulation content occupies expanded dimensionality at encoding.
    Self-reference already expands geometry in the input representation.

  If signatures are response-driven (WEAK finding):
    Input-only geometry shows flat/random category differences.
    All signatures collapse without generation.
    The cache is an empty canvas until the model starts writing.

This is the single highest-value adversarial control because it defends
every experiment simultaneously.

Usage:
  python 08_input_only_geometry.py --scale 7B --runs 5 --seed 42
  python 08_input_only_geometry.py --scale 1.1B --runs 3 --seed 42
  python 08_input_only_geometry.py --dry-run

Runtime: ~10 min at 7B (no generation = milliseconds per inference).
