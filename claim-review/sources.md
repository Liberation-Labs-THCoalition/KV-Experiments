# Source Reference for Claim Revision

Cross-references every workstream's claims with internal data, cited papers, and
missing literature that should be consulted when revising the paper.

**Legend**:
- **INTERNAL** — data files and code in this repo
- **CITED** — already in `paper-c2/references.bib`
- **MISSING** — not cited; should be read and potentially added
- **FLAG** — bibliographic error or concern requiring attention

## Bibliography-Level Flags

These issues affect the bibliography itself, independent of any workstream.

| # | Issue | Detail |
|---|-------|--------|
| B1 | **Watson author mismatch** | Bib entry `watson2019ita` lists author "Marcus Watson". Competitive landscape doc (Cricket) references "Nell Watson" as IEEE ethics committee member. These appear to be different people. Verify which Watson is the actual author of the ITA. |
| B2 | **Apollo Research authors wrong** | Bib entry `goldowskydill2025detecting` lists co-authors "Sarao Mannelli, Casper". S2 returns "Chughtai, Heimersheim, Hobbhahn" for arXiv:2502.03407. Either the bib has wrong authors or references a different paper. |
| B3 | **Abliteration paper not cited** | Arditi et al. 2024 "Refusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction" (arXiv:2406.11717, 493 citations) — the foundational abliteration paper — is not in the bibliography despite the experiment using their technique via Heretic. |
| B4 | **22 orphaned entries** | Final report found 22 of 28 bib entries are never `\cite{}`d in the paper text. |
| B5 | **Hewitt & Liang vs Hewitt & Manning** | Bib has `hewitt2019structural` (syntax probe, Hewitt & Manning). The paper needs Hewitt & Liang 2019 "Designing and Interpreting Probes with Control Tasks" (EMNLP, 612 citations) for the length-confound methodology. Different paper, different co-author. |

## Cross-Cutting: Discrepancy Resolution Map

Which sources help address each of the 12 discrepancies:

| Discrepancy | Key Source to Consult |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **D1**: Deception direction not architecture-dependent | Goldowsky-Dill (Apollo) — how do linear probes handle direction? |
| **D2**: Bloom inverted-U contradicted | Huber & Niklaus 2025, Raimondi & Gabbrielli 2026 — what do others find? |
| **D3**: Bloom length confound | **Hewitt & Liang 2019** — control task methodology is the standard fix |
| **D4**: Identity classification data leak | **Yagis et al. 2021**, **Tampu et al. 2022** — document known inflation patterns |
| **D5**: Deduplication never applied | No external source — fix the code, call `deduplicate_runs()` |
| **D6**: Missing TOST for null claims | **Lakens 2017**, **Lakens et al. 2018** — proper equivalence testing protocol |
| **D7**: Watson falsification tests wrong variable | Verify Watson ITA source exists. If unpublished, reframe from "definitive falsification" to "preliminary test" |
| **D8**: Cricket cross-document discrepancies | Internal — update Cricket docs to match corrected paper numbers |
| **D9**: "Deduplication applied" is false | No external source — correct the Methods section |
| **D10**: log(length) vs raw length | **Hewitt & Liang 2019** — correct the code or correct the Methods claim |
| **D11**: Limitation mischaracterizes RDCT | Watson ITA source — reread to accurately describe what was tested |
| **D12**: "Every C1 finding confirmed" is false | Internal — acknowledge sycophancy was dropped; cite its omission |
| **D13**: Watson 1/e threshold lacks formal citation | See flag B1 — verify if any citable version exists; if not, reframe falsification language |
| **D14**: 22 of 28 bib entries uncited | See flag B4 — audit with `cite_verify.py scan_tex_cites` and prune or cite |
